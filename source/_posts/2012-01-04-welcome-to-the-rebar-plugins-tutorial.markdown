A warm welcome if you're new to the series. I'm still getting my head around 
both Jekyll and Octopress, so the structure of the site has been changing quite
a bit. What I've finally settled on is

- stand-alone pages for the individual articles in the series
- a separate blog (i.e., what you're reading now!) with news and updates

I hope this format works for readers and makes it easy to find your way around
the site.
